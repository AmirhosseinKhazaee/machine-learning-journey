# 📚 **Calculus Library for Machine Learning Optimization**  

Welcome to the **Calculus Library**, where I’ve implemented core calculus concepts essential for machine learning and optimization. This project is part of my machine learning journey, documenting everything I’ve learned, from **gradient descent** to **Newton's method** and more, all in Python!  

---

## 🚀 **Features**  

### 1. **Gradient Descent**  
- Implementation of gradient descent for optimization in both single and multivariable functions.  
- A simple yet powerful method for minimizing cost functions, used in linear regression and other machine learning models.  

### 2. **Linear Regression**  
- Applying gradient descent to predict outputs based on input features.  
- A foundational machine learning algorithm for supervised learning tasks.  

### 3. **Newton's Method**  
- A faster and more powerful alternative to gradient descent.  
- Includes three variations of Newton’s method for optimization and root finding.  
- Implementation with examples for both single and multivariable functions.  

### 4. **Structured Class Design**  
- All methods are encapsulated within a single Python class (`Calculus.py`) for clarity and reusability.

## 💡 **How to Use**  

Here’s a simple example of using the library:  

```python  
from Calculus import Calculus  

# Initialize the class  
calc = Calculus()  

# Perform gradient descent  
result = calc.gradient_descent(f=lambda x: x**2, df=lambda x: 2*x, x0=10, learning_rate=0.1)  
print("Optimal value using Gradient Descent:", result)  

# Use Newton's method for optimization  
result = calc.newtons_method(f=lambda x: x**2 - 4, df=lambda x: 2*x, d2f=lambda x: 2, x0=3)  
print("Root using Newton's Method:", result)  
```

## 📝 **Learnings and Reflections**  
Through this project, I’ve:  
- Deepened my understanding of **gradient descent** and its role in optimization.  
- Learned the nuances of **Newton's method** and its applications in finding roots and optimizing functions.  
- Explored the connection between calculus and machine learning algorithms like **linear regression**.  

---

## 🛠️ **Future Plans**  
- Adding implementations for advanced optimization techniques (e.g., Adam, RMSProp).  
- Expanding the library to include numerical methods for integration and differential equations.  
- Developing a simple GUI to visualize gradient descent and Newton’s method.
