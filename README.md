## 🧑‍💻 Gradient Descent Optimization Project

This project demonstrates the **gradient descent** optimization algorithm applied to minimize a mathematical function `f(x) = (x-3)^2 + 5`. The goal is to demonstrate how gradient descent works through multiple iterations of optimization.

### 📝 Description:
- **Objective**: The project aims to find the minimum of the function by iteratively updating the value of `x` based on the gradient.
- **Versions**:
  - **Version 1**: A basic gradient descent implementation using a fixed learning rate.
  - **Version 2**: An enhanced version with additional features and improved flexibility in the stopping condition.

### 🚀 Usage:
To run the project, clone the repository and run the scripts in the `Phase_1_Math_Foundations` directory:
```bash
python Phase_1_Math_Foundations/gradient_descent_v1.py
python Phase_1_Math_Foundations/gradient_descent_v2.py
